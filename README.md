Final-Project

  The player uses the "d" key to move right and the "k" key to jump. As the player moves right, further into the level,  the background moves past the character to the left. The backgorund includes clouds, bushes, and holes.
  The player has 3 lives.
  At the end of the game, the player faces a final villain. If he/she defeats the villain, he/she has won the game.
