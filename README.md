Final-Project
=============
Basic Project Description
-------------------------

After the start screen, the player moves his/her character through the level by pressing the "d" button. The "h" button makes the character jump. The background moves as the character moves, producing bad guys, obstacles, and coins. Touching an obstacle damages the character by decreasing his size. Once the "d" key is hit a certain number of times, a warp tunnel appears. If the character goes into the tunnel, he is transported to the final battle with the villain. If the player defeats the villain, he/she wins the game.

Different character options, power ups, and levels may be added to the game.

Final Project Description

The game inolves six main screens put together in order to make a final finishing project, and a running game. 
I will go through each of the screens one by one and explain what they do and any special featurs about them.

First sceen is just a title screen and it has two booleans that either bring you to the game or to an info screen. 
If the info button is pressed, you go to a screen that explains the instructions involving the game.
You can press a back button in order to go back to the start screen. Pressing the actual start button will bring you to the actual game.

The seccond screen is the "choseing character screen". 
Here you click on what character you want, which is either sonic or mario. After clicking on the character you want you press the play button in order to go to the actual playable game.

The third screen is the first part of the playable game. In this section you can controll and move you character.
To move your character forward you press the 'd' button. This doesent actuall move the character but moves the back ground behind him to give the aperence of the character moving.
