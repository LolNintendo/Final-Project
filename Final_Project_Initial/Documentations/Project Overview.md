Description
------------

This game is a version of the Mario world with Sonic characters.
We may include a start screen which involves the player chosing a specific nintendo character they want to use throughout their mission.

  The player uses the "d" key to move right and the "h" key to jump. As the player moves right, further into the level, the background moves past the character to the left. The backgorund includes clouds, bushes, mountains, and holes. The player shall also be trying to avoid bad guys that randomly generate as the character moves forward. If the character touches the obsticle it will be damaged. The player can either jump over the bad guys, or duck under them depending on what type of character is created.  
  Another thing that randomly spawns are coins. The player must catch the coins in order to boost up his/her score, while avoiding the dangerous characters.
  The player has one life. He/she will start out bigger as in Mario and if the character gets hit, it will shrink. If the character gets hit one more time, the character dies and falls off the screen.
  Once the player hits the "d" key a certain number of times a warp pipe appears. When the character moves close enough to the warp pipe it will be transported to the boss battle. At the end of the game, the player faces the final villain. If he/she defeats the villain, he/she has won the game. The player can defeat the boss by either stepping on a button behind the boss or by shooting him (we will pick one as the game progresses). The boss will also be shooting at the character as well.
