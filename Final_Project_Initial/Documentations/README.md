Basic Project Description
=========================

The player moves his/her character through the level by pressing the "d" button. The "h" button makes the character jump. The background moves as the character moves, producing bad guys, obstacles, and coins. Touching an obstacle damages the character by decreasing his size. Once the "d" key is hit a certain number of times, a warp tunnel appears. If the character goes into the tunnel, he is transported to the final battle with the villain. If the player defeats the villain, he/she wins.
