Final-Project
=============

The game is a version of the Mario world with Sonic characters.
We may include a start screen which involves the player chosing a specific nitendo character that they want to use throughout their mission.

  The player uses the "d" key to move right and the "h" key to jump. As the player moves right, further into the level,  the background moves past the character to the left. The backgorund includes clouds, bushes,mountains and holes.
 The player shall also be trying to avoid bad guys that randomly generate as he moves forward. If he touches the obsticle he will be damaged. The player can either jump over the bad guys, or he can duck under them depending on what type of character.  
 Another thing that randomly spawns are coins.The player must catch the coins in order to boost up his score, while he avoids the dangerous guys.
 The player has one life. He will start out bigger as in mario and if he gets hit will shrink. If he gets hit one more time then he will die and fall of the screen.
  Once the player hits the "d" key a certain number of times a warp pipe will appear. When he moves close enough to the warp pipe he will be transported to a boss battle. At the end of the game, the player faces a final villain. If he/she defeats the villain, he/she has won the game.He can defeat the boss by either stepping on a button behind the boss or by shooting him. The boss will also be shooting at the character as well.
