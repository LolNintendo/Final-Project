Description
------------

This game is a version of the Mario world with Sonic characters.
A start screen involves the player chosing a specific nintendo character they want to use throughout their mission.

  The player uses the 'd' key to move right and the 'h' key to jump. As the player moves right, further into the level, the background moves past the character to the left. The background includes clouds, bushes, and mountains. The player shall also be trying to avoid bad guys that randomly generate as the character moves forward. If the character touches the obsticle it will lose a life. The player must jump over the bad guys to avoid them because he/she only has three lives.

  If the character loses all three lives, the character dies and falls off the screen. It is game over, and the game over screen appears.
  Once the player hits the 'd' key 75 times a warp pipe appears. When the character moves close enough to the warp pipe it will be transported to the tunnel where he will obtain a power. Then the character continues moving down the screen into the boss battle. At the end of the game, the player faces the final villain Bowser. If he/she defeats the villain by shooting him through the 'g' key five times, he/she has won the game. The boss will also be shooting at the character as well.
  When the player wins, a victory screen comes up.
